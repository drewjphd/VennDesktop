An argument is <b>valid</b> if and only if it is not possible for its premise(s) to be true and its conclusion false. An argument is invalid if and only if it is not valid. Consider:
<p>
All apples are fruit. <br>
--------------------- <br>
All fruit are apples.
<p>
It is possible for the premise of this argument to be true and the conclusion to be false. Now, consider a valid argument:
<p>
All apples are fruit. <br>
--------------------- <br>
All non-fruit are non-apples.
<p>
In this case, it is not possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false. (A valid argument may have premises which are in fact false. Note the claim of validity is that if the <b>premises were true</b>, then the <b>conclusion must be true</b> as well.)  Thus,
<p>
All fruit are apples.<br>
--------------------- <br>
All non-fruit are non-apples.
<p>
is valid because <b>if</b> “all fruit were apples” were true, <b>then</b> “all non-apples are non-fruit” would have to be true as well. 
<p>
Of course, we normally seek valid arguments that in fact have true premises, because this guarantees the truth of their conclusions. A valid argument with true premises is called a <b>sound argument</b>. An argument that is not sound, either because it has a false premise or because it is not valid, is an <b>unsound</b> argument. Whether a premise is true usually requires investigating the facts of the world and Venn Diagrams cannot help us know that.  But, Venn Diagrams can help us establish the logical relationship between premises and conclusion and therefore if is very useful in determining validity or invalidity of class logic using the four kinds of sentences.
