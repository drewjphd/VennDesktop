<b>Sentence and Sentence with Complements</b>
<p>
Represent the information expressed by a sentence by marking a diagram (see Marking Venn Diagrams). Use the <b>Check Diagram</b> button to check whether your diagram is correct. If you are stuck, then use the <b>Show Solution</b> button to see the correct answer.

<p>
<b>Immediate Inference and Immediate Inference with Complements</b>
<p>
To determine the validity of an immediate inference, represent the information expressed by the premise on the premise diagram. Similarly, represent the information expressed by the conclusion on the conclusion diagram. If all of the information diagrammed for the conclusion is also contained in the diagram for the premise, then the argument is valid. Select valid in the upper right hand corner to check your assessment of validity. If the information marked in the conclusion diagram is not also completely contained in the diagram of the premise, then the argument is invalid. You can use the <b>Check Diagram</b> button and the <b>Show Solution</b> button for confirmation and help with your analysis.
<hr>
<p>
<b>Syllogism</b>
<p>
To determine the validity of a syllogism, represent the information contained in both premises, and then diagram the information in the conclusion. Check whether all of the information diagrammed in the conclusion is also diagrammed in the information for the premises. If so, the syllogism is valid and you can select Valid in the upper right hand corner to verify your assessment. If the information diagrammed in the conclusion is not completely contained in the information diagrammed in the premises, the syllogism is invalid. If an argument is valid, its premises may claim more is true than its conclusion claims, but its premises cannot claim less than the conclusion claims. Once again you can use the <b>Check Diagram</b> button and the <b>Show Solution</b> button for confirmation and help with your analysis.
