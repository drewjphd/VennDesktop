Syllogisms are distinguished by their figure and mood. The <b>mood</b> is the series of forms of sentences that occur in a particular syllogism. Moods are expressed as a triple of letters. For example, a syllogism with a mood AEE has its first premise in the A-form, its second premise in the E-form, and its conclusion in the E-form.
<p>
The <b>figure</b> of a syllogism is identified by the location of the middle term. In the first figure, the middle term appears in the subject of the first premise and the predicate of the second premise. In the second figure, the middle term appears in the predicate of both premises. In the third figure, the middle term appears in the subject position of both premises. In the fourth figure, the middle term appears in the predicate of the first premise and the subject of the second premise.
<p>
When practicing syllogisms on Venn the mood of the syllogism can be changed simply by clicking on the letters of the sentence forms and the figure of the syllogism can be changed equally simply by clicking on the icons for the figures of the syllogism.
