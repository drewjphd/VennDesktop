<b>Sentences</b>
<p>Traditional <b>class logic</b> uses four forms of sentences which are traditionally labeled A, E, I and O.
<p><b>A</b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp All __________ are __________.
<p><b>E</b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp No __________ are __________.
<p><b>I</b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Some __________ are __________.
<p><b>O</b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Some __________ are not __________.
<p> The blanks are filled in with different class terms to generate sentences. For example, "All Siberian huskies are stubborn dogs" is a sentence of the A-form which expresses a relation between Siberian huskies and stubborn dogs. The blanks may also be filled in with the terms for the complements of classes, e.g., "Some non-amphibians are not non-mammals".

<b>Immediate Inferences</b>
<p>Sentences can be combined to produce arguments in which some sentences, the premises, are taken to support another sentence, the conclusion. An <b>immediate inference</b> is an argument which has only one premise and a conclusion each in the form A, E, I or O. For example, the following is an immediate inference.
<p> 
    No plants are animals. (premise)<br>
    ----------------------<br>
    No animals are plants. (conclusion)
<p>
This is a good argument in that it is <b>valid</b>. An argument is valid if and only if it is not possible for its premise(s) to be true and its conclusion false. Here is an invalid argument:
<p>
    Some animals are dogs. (premise)<br>
    ----------------------<br>
    All animals are dogs. (conclusion)
<p> 
Notice that in this case it is possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false, therefore this argument is invalid.

<p>
<b>Syllogisms</b>
<p>
A special form of argument, the syllogism, plays a prominent role in traditional class logic. Here is an example of a syllogism:
<p>
All reptiles are animals. (premise) <br>
Some snakes are reptiles. (premise)<br>
-------------------------<br>
Some snakes are animals. (conclusion)
<p>
A <b>syllogism</b> is an argument that has two premises and a conclusion each in the form A, E, I or O and that has exactly three class terms: a major term (predicate of conclusion and occurs in first premise), a minor term (subject of conclusion and occurs in second premise) and a middle term (occurs in both premises).
