Venn diagrams consist of intersecting circles. Each represents a class of objects, and it is labeled with a term for that class. The regions of the diagram where circles overlap represents the possibility of classes having some objects in common. Initially, circles have no marks on them indicating that nothing is claimed about whether the classes have members.
<p>
* To indicate that a region is empty select 'None' and then click on the region that you wish to mark as empty.  (Shading an area on a Venn Diagram means nothing is in that area.)
<br>
* To indicate that a region has some member select 'Some' and then click on the area in which you wish to indicate that something is there. (An asterisk means there is something there.)
<br>
* To indicate that one of two adjacent regions has a member put an asterisk on the line separating the regions.  (An asterisk on a line indicates that there is something in at least one of the two areas separated by the line but you do not know which area.)
<br>
* To remove any markings select Erase Area and then click on the shading or asterisk that you wish erased.
<br>
* To remove all markings from a Venn Diagram use the Clear Diagram button.
